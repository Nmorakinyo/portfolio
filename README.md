# Welcome to my Portfolio/Personal Business Websites

This is my Personal Business Website (or Portfolio) designed as my final Project on Course 22F_MTM6201_020 Web Development of my IMD Program at Algonquin College, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

## Objective of this Project

The objective of this Projrct is to create my Personal Business Website (or Portfolio) using the mockups from my User Experience (UI) course using the Bootstrap framework. 


## Process
The mockup from my UI course has theee pages - Homepage (having a background image (office.jpg), About page (having  red background colour) and Contact page (having a background image of boardmtg.jpg).

I set out the layout of my website using Bootstrap 5. I defined the rows horizontally as needed and I also defined the columns based on the boostrap's maximum 12-column grid in each row. Here are my step-by-step process:

-Set out my website layout with Bootstrap.
-Define number of rows as needed for each of the webpages - Each web pages has about 3-4 rows
-Divide each row to no of columns required as container for my contents respecting the Bootstrap's 12 column rule.
-Use Google layout fonts to obtain icons for social media links and others
-Add soial media links on all my pages
-Use Bootstrap's navbar.
-Use bootstrap's buttons as needed for various elements on my web pages.
-Use boostrap to style my headings, texts. buttons
-Adds one additional CSS library besides bootstrap (Use animate.css on all mt 3 pages)
-creates a form that senda email

## Challenges
Since I am new to boostrap, I had to do a lot of studypng to be able to do this Project. I also did a lot of searching to add Font Awesome Icons, CSS libraries and so on.
